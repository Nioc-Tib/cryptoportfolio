# Your own local and interactive portfolio

My goal with this project was to create a crypto portfolio that you can store on a local database (mongodb is used here).

The main benefit from that is to avoid sharing your information about your holdings with private companies such as Delta of Blockfolio.

I used the coingecko api for price feed.

Whate you can do with this app : - Add crypto to your portfolio : one important thing when doing so is to use the coingecko id name that can be found on their website on each coin page under Overview -> Widget - Update a specific crypto amount - Remove a crypto from your portfolio

I might add some more features in the future like sell/buy orders and keeping track of your portfolio performance.

Obviously this web app has not be deployed in production and require a running dev environment.

Hope you enjoy it !
